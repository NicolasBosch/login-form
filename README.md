# login-form

Very basic and simple user registration and login form, just the logic, no styling.

## Setup

- Create a database and run the login.sql file inside the DB folder to set up the users table. Once set up, delete the DB folder.
- Edit the config.php file with the path of the root folder for your project and the database parameters.
- You can modify the validation and sanitation functions inside the validation.php file to change the parameters for validation.
